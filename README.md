##### Donating the equivalent of one cup of â˜• each month helps a lot ðŸ’›

#### AbyssUI is a minimalist World of Warcraft interface. It changes parts of the interface so you can have a more customizable and clean UI. The goals was to have a high customizable interface, that changes little to the wow artwork/functionality.

#### FAQ
#### - How to make interface looks like in the video?
#### A: The white buttons was another project that was discontinued due to the lack of time and the amount of work that was needed to make it work under different conditions. It may still work, but no support or upcoming updates are planned.

#### - The interface options from the old classic version of the UI will be implemented later?
#### A: Yes. The idea is to have this only UI, and that it can work in any client of wow, with all options from later versions included.

#### - Do you plan to add save profiles to the UI?
#### A: No, at least it's not on my plans right now. At this point, the interface have so many options and I have short time to work on it, so it's not planned.

#### - Where can I find support?
#### A: Easy way is to go to the AbyssUI Discord Channel.

#### - Some texture are looking/acting weird or Texture/Image is not right or cropped??
#### A: You are probably using a old version of AbyssUI, try a fresh installation, delete the old version and re-download it.

#### - Buttons are gray or in another color instead of the default, and I don't want this?
#### A: Go to the AbyssUI options (/abyssui options) and check "Disable Button Color Text".

##### Please Report any bug.
